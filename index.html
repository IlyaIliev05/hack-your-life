        <h2 id="lifehack">What is Lifehack?</h2>
        <div id="about">
            <p>
                A life hack (or life hacking) is any trick, shortcut, skill, or novelty method that increases productivity and 
                efficiency, in all walks of life. The term was primarily used by computer experts who suffer from information overload 
                or those with a playful curiosity in the ways they can accelerate their workflow in ways other than programming.
            </p>

            <h2 id="lifehack">History</h2>
            <p>
                The original definition of the term "hack" is "to cut with rough or heavy blows". In the modern vernacular it has often 
                been used to describe an inelegant but effective solution to a specific computing problem, such as quick-and-dirty shell 
                scripts and other command line utilities that filtered, munged and processed data streams like e-mail and RSS feeds. 
                The term was later extended to life hack, in reference to a solution to a problem unrelated to computers that might occur in a programmer's everyday life.
                 Examples of these types of life hacks might include utilities to synchronize files, track tasks, remind oneself of events, or filter e-mail.

            <h4>Uitilise Caffeine</h4>
            <p>
                Caffeine aids in kicking the brain into gear for studying. It is most beneficial when used in 
                small breaks throughout studying, rather than in one huge dose prior to studying. 
                This will ensure that your brain gets continual kick starts, as opposed to one huge jolt followed
                by a dramatic crash.
            </p>
            <h4>Talk to your Teachers</h4>
            <p>
                These are the people that make all of your tests, so take the time to talk with them. You will be able 
                to gain insight into how they are thinking, allowing you to study in a way that will benefit you when taking tests.
                It won't hurt to ask your teachers what they will be looking for on the test and find out exactly
                what you will need to study.
            </p>
            <h4>Use Mnemonic Strategies</h4>
            <p>
                Making up your own allow you to remember sequences and key concepts with ease. This does take a bit of time, but creating 
                your own mnemonic devices is the difference between active learning and passive learning. This strategy has proven to improve 
                an individual's ability to remember. If you don't want to make up your own, search the internet for some that relate to 
                the subject that you are studying.
            </p>
            <h4>Chew Gum When Studying</h4>
            <p>
                Studies have shown that when you chew gum, your focus and concentration are boosted. Don't stop there! You can also chew gum 
                while you are taking a test or exam. This forms a connection in the brain that will help you remember what you studied while you were
                chewing gum. This kind of study hack is called context dependency.
            </p>
            <h4>Block Out Distractions</h4>
            <p>
                Aim to avoid extraneous activities on your computer, tablet, or phone while studying. Try to turn them off and place them in another room. 
                If you don't have enough self-restraint, there are free apps that will restrict your access to specified websites for a predetermined 
                amount of time.
            </p>
            <h4>Tackle it in Small Portions</h4>
            <p>
                When there is a large portion of information that needs to be learned, break it down into smaller, more manageable portions. Don't 
                do it all at once. Rather, you should aim to learn a different portion each day. Furthermore, do not start a new portion until
                you have the current one down.
            </p>
            <h4>Try Studying in a New Space</h4>
            <p>
                Aim to switch up where you study every day. When you change studying spaces, it will force your brain to form new memories each time, 
                making it more likely that you will retain the new material.
            </p>
            <h4>Read Your Notes Out Loud</h4>
            <p>
                Read them out loud to yourself, with a friend, or even to your cat. When you speak and hear the words, it will help to reinforce
                 the material in a new way. When you find a partner, this study hack will benefit both of you.
            </p>
            <h4>Read Before The Lecture</h4>
            <p>
                This is the best way to get the most out of your classes. It will reinforce the materialâ€”twice. 
                It will also help you answer questions that your teacher poses to the class.
            </p>
            <h4>Study With The Right Music</h4>
            <p>
                Unfamiliar music or ambient noise has the potential to boost productivity. Remember though, 
                that familiar music has the potential to have the opposite effect. There are plenty of ways to find 
                the right type of noise. Finding an internet radio station with instrumental music or video game 
                soundtracks will do the trick.
