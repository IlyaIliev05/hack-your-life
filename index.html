        <div id="about">
            <p>
                A life hack (or life hacking) is any trick, shortcut, skill, or novelty method that increases productivity and 
                efficiency, in all walks of life. The term was primarily used by computer experts who suffer from information overload 
                or those with a playful curiosity in the ways they can accelerate their workflow in ways other than programming.

            <p>
                The original definition of the term "hack" is "to cut with rough or heavy blows". In the modern vernacular it has often 
                been used to describe an inelegant but effective solution to a specific computing problem, such as quick-and-dirty shell 
                scripts and other command line utilities that filtered, munged and processed data streams like e-mail and RSS feeds. 
                The term was later extended to life hack, in reference to a solution to a problem unrelated to computers that might occur in a programmer's everyday life.
                 Examples of these types of life hacks might include utilities to synchronize files, track tasks, remind oneself of events, or filter e-mail.
