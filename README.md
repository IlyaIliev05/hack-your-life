## Challenges

Being my first ever project, it's needless to say that I found it very challenging in terms of selecting the right content,
building the right foundation on which to add the layout of my work in terms of color scheme, text structure and presentation and overall code quality. My aim was to eliminate errors in my code and offer a clean and easy to grasp website that is visually pleasing and of entertaining nature.

#### Code: 
https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp - This particular website helped me with adding my media query and making my website responsive for different screen sizes.

```css
/* Media Queries for small screen sizes from 950px wide and down */

@media screen and (max-width: 950px) {
    .vertical-center {
        top: 20%;
    }
}
```
